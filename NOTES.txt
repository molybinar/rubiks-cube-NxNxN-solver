Need to determine next move
- try all 36 moves, are there any that give us a hit in our lookup table?

- try all 36 moves, are there any moves that reduce the heuristic for all prune tables?
  This seems very unlikely but if there is it would be the obvious choice for next move.

- try all 36 moves and rank them based on the total heuristic.  Only keep the best 10% of moves?

- have some cap on how deep we are willing to search

36^2 is 1,296
36^3 is 46,656
36^4 is 1,679,616
36^5 is 60,466,176

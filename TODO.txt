- build these prune tables for solving all 4x centers at once
    - UD, UL, UF, UR, UB
    - LF, LR, LB, LD
    - FR, FB, FD
    - RB, RD
    - BD
    - That is 15 prune tables...is that too many?

- implement these 5 heuristics

    errors: Number of stickers that are not on the correct face. This number is
        then divided by 12 so that the resulting heuristic is admissible. (It is
        possible to move 12 stickers in a single move.)

    # For 4x centers we would divide by 8...so the max the heuristic can ever
    # return is 3...I doubt this will be that useful


    distance: The same as previous but stickers that need
        to go to the opposite face count as two because they
        require at least two moves to be placed correctly. The
        number is then also divided in order to be admissible.

    # This is because they were only using quarter turns, with half turns
    # you only need the 'errors' heuristic


    pairs-different: The total number of neighbouring
        pairs of stickers that are not in correct place. Neighbouring
        pair consists of two stickers on the same
        face that are next to each other (i.e. touching by an
        edge). Among all neighbouring pairs, we count those
        in which the two stickers have different colors. The
        number is then again normalized so that the estimate
        is admissible.

    # If we ignore the diagonals on a center (I think we should) there are
    # four "pairs" per side so 24 pairs total.  At most 2 could be paired
    # per side via a turn so divide by 8.

    face-different: The same as before but we consider
        every two stickers that are on the same face as a pair
        even if they are not next to each other.

    # For 4x centers they are all "next" to each other so we just need
    # pairs-different.

    face-error: This only considers one specific face and
        counts how well it is completed

The mentioned heuristics may look very similar but they
actually work differently. For example, if we use the
heuristics pairs-different and face-different to search for
a solution of 8x8x8 cube, we get a very different kinds
of states. Figures 1 and 2 show two states where the
two heuristics got stuck respectively. The pairs-different
heuristic (figure 1) created a number of connected components
of the same color on each face, while face-different
(figure 2) maximized the total number of colored stickers
that are together on each face but it didnâ€™t create any coherent
patterns.
